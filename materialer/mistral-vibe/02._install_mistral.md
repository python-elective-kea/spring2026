# Installing a developer version of Mistral Vibe

## **1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# or
# uv venv .venv
```

- **Activate the virtual environment**:
  - **Linux/Mac**:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
  - **Windows**:
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

---

## **2. Install Your Forked Version**
Navigate to the directory where you cloned your forked repository and install it in the virtual environment:

```bash
cd path/to/your/forked/mistral-cli
pip install -e .

# or 
# uv pip install -e .
# or same/same
# uv install -e .
```

---

## **3. Verify the Installation**
Check if the `vibe` command is available and points to your forked version:

```bash
which vibe  # Linux/Mac
```
or
```bash
where vibe  # Windows
```

- This should show the path to the `vibe` executable inside your virtual environment.

---

## **4. Use Your Forked Version**
With the virtual environment activated, simply run:

```bash
vibe
```

- This will start the CLI application using your forked version.

---

## **5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment**
When you’re done testing, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```
